To recreate this analysis, run this line:
../water_msd.py test.pdb test.prmtop test.5_frames.dcd TEST 

Reprinting the pocket_residues.py script for recreating this analysis:
wat_resname = 'resname WAT'
 pocket_sel = 'protein and (resid 27:35 or resid 60 or resid 63:64 or resid 117:118 or resid 147 or resid 149 or resid 159 or resid 245:249 or resid 288:289 or resid 292:293 or resid 296)'
 radius = 6.000000

Output files are:
	TEST.nRes.dat 		--> holds the number of residues within the defined pocket
	TEST.waters.dat 		--> holds the atom numbers of the water oxygens that are within the defined pocket
	TEST.cog.xyz		--> A XYZ trajectory of the Center Of Geometry (COG) of the defined pocket; waters within radius of this point are considered within the defined pocket; Note you should always check that the radius is accurately describing all timesteps in your trajectory...
	TEST.msd.pocket.dat 	--> holds the dt, counts, <MSD>, and <MSD^2> data of waters within the defined pocket
	TEST.long_lived.dat	--> outputs a vmd atomselection to use to show the long lived waters in the un-truncated trajectories
